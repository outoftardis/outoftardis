### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a technical writer with 6+ years of experience, and Iâ€™m currently looking for new job opportunities. 

Here is a brief overview of my experience:
- Supported technical documentation for various software products at Intel and Soramitsu.
- Worked with a variety of tools and markup languages (Sphinx, Doxygen, Git, internal CMS, XMetal, DITA, reStructuredText, Markdown, LaTeX, VitePress).
- Worked on quality assurance initiatives and quality checks automation. Used Python scripting skills to contribute to the validation tools and procedures.
- Took part in standardization initiatives: contributed to the development of an internal style guide, drafted guidelines for other technical writers, created templates.
- Reviewed and edited additional materials (blogs, articles) created to promote the supported products. Peer-reviewed technical documentation for other products.
